# Frustrated Ising Models

This repository demonstrates exact renormalization group (RG) calculations for frustrated Ising models on complex hierarchical lattices, as described in the paper [Spin-Glass Behavior in Frustrated Ising Models with Chaotic Renormalization-Group Trajectories](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.767). The repository includes code to implement the hierarchical Ising model and visualize RG flows and bifurcation diagram.

## Background

The Ising model is a fundamental model in statistical mechanics used to describe systems with interacting spins. In the Ising model, each spin can be in one of two states, "up" or "down". The spins interact with neighboring spins, and the energy of the system depends on the configuration of the spins.

In a frustrated Ising model, the interactions between spins are such that it is impossible to minimize the energy of the system simultaneously for all pairs of spins. This frustration can lead to complex behavior and phase transitions.

Hierarchical lattices are a class of lattices that have a self-similar structure. This means that they can be constructed by recursively combining smaller lattices. Hierarchical lattices are often used to study the effects of disorder and complexity on physical systems.
